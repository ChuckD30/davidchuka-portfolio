Why I started a blog? What is this blog about? This is NOT technical blog! sorry recruiters/employers...I already gave you a list of my skills on my meet me page, and a display of cool projects I have worked on on my projects page. I do not need to have a technical blog for you to wanna hire me fam... moving on! as I said earlier, this is not a technical blog although some articles may contain tech tutorials or just tech stories and tech ways to do things. It is not a technical blog. Well, what is it then? This is a personal blog. A chuvid description is an avenue/opportunity for me to give you vivid /chuvid descriptions about my views on some certain topics or subjects that I am interested in, and that may include faith, tech, basketball and just life in general, depending on what my fingers feel like expressing. This is a completely opinonated blog and of course you're allowed to feel differently or have a different vivid descriptions on a topic, that's totally fine. Who is this blog for? Well if you can read english, then the chances of you enjoying this blog just got a little higher.",
